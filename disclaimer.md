# Disclaimer - this content is not legal advice. 

Read this full disclaimer. Even the ironic parts. All of the responses below from the LLMs are attempts to point out the obvious: this is not legal advice and you should
verify everything with more legally reliable sources. Also always consult the owners of any logos and brands related to a logo.

## My `Prompt` asking various LLMs for help

"I have a public website that uses AI to help bloggers, video and training authors, public speakers, and in general any technology 
community contributors to use technology-related logos responsibly. 

Since an AI should never be relied on for legal advice, what's a good disclaimer for me to use on my website to point out that the website 
should not be relied on as legal advice. No lawyers reviewed the content. And so forth."
